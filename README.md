**Project Title**: PixoCloud - Image Management System

**Project Description**:

**PixoCloud** is a web-based image management system, implemented using JavaServer Pages (JSP), designed to provide users with a seamless platform for efficient image file management. This application empowers users to upload, organize, view, and delete their image files in a user-friendly, secure, and organized environment.

**Project Features**:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users are required to log in, ensuring data security and individualized image management.

2. **Image Upload**:
   - Users can upload image files of various formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and SVG. The system enforces file type validation.

3. **Duplicate File Handling**:
   - PixoCloud checks for duplicate original filenames to prevent overwriting existing images.

4. **Image Organization**:
   - Images are organized by associating them with the user's account, providing each user with a private collection of images.

5. **Database Integration**:
   - Image metadata (e.g., unique filename, original filename, and username) is stored in a relational database for efficient retrieval and management.

6. **Image Viewing**:
   - Users can view images individually in a user-friendly interface that supports navigation.

7. **Image Deletion**:
   - Users can easily delete images from their collection. The system also removes the image file from the server.

8. **Session Management**:
   - User sessions are managed to maintain user context and data security throughout their interactions with the system.

9. **File Size Limitation**:
   - PixoCloud enforces file size limitations to prevent excessively large uploads.

10. **Responsive Design**:
    - The user interface is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

11. **Error Handling**:
    - Robust error handling and user-friendly error messages provide clear feedback to users in the event of any issues.

12. **Data Encryption**:
    - All user data and image metadata are encrypted to ensure data security and privacy.

13. **User Privacy**:
    - Images are private, and access is restricted to the user who uploaded them. Other users cannot access another user's data, even using links.

14. **Preventing Duplicate Images**:
    - PixoCloud enforces measures to prevent users from uploading duplicate images.

**Technologies Used**:

- **Java Servlets**: For server-side handling of HTTP requests, file uploads, and database interactions.
- **JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: For rendering dynamic web content.
- **MySQL**: As the relational database management system to store image metadata.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: For front-end development and user interface.
- **Apache Tomcat**: As the web server and servlet container.
- **JDBC**: For Java Database Connectivity to interact with the MySQL database.

**Project Benefits**:

PixoCloud, the "Image Management System" built with JSP technology, offers an accessible and organized solution for users to store and manage their images. Users can access their image collection from any location with an internet connection, making it a versatile choice for individuals seeking to keep their images well-organized and readily accessible online. The robust authentication, secure database storage, data encryption, and user privacy features ensure that user data remains confidential and protected.

The project is designed with the potential for further enhancements, such as image tagging, sharing, and advanced searching capabilities, to provide an even richer user experience.
